sample project
======

This codebase serves as a test project for US Signal Software Development applicants. The project utilizes the following technologies: 

* PHP 5.4+
* Composer
* Zend Framework 2
* Doctrine 2
* PHPUnit
* Twitter Boostrap

The applicant must setup their own Apache and PHP environment. The sample project is already setup and ready to be checked out. There is a Customers Index (/customers/) page which lists all customers in the sample database. This sample code shows how the applicant should integrate Doctrine with ZF2. The database used for this sample project is a SQLite database stored in data/sample.db.

Additionally, the Doctrine mappings are already defined for customers, as well as entities. 

The applicant will be required to: 

* Fork this project on their own GitHub. 
* Implement their given task.
* Create any necessary database objects. Create entities for those data objects, and map them properly in the Doctrine mapping files. 
* Commit all code back to their own GitHub and send a link when finished.
